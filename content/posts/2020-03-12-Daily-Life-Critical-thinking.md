Critical thinking refers to the process of making conclusions or acting on judgments obtained by reviewing them as objective evidences in a reasonable and logical manner when facing a situation. You should carefully examine whether there are any errors in your claim or that there are no errors in the facts.

Critical thinking needs to be able to differentiate between facts and opinions, and it is necessary to assert or evaluate opinions on a reasonable and sufficient basis. In order to compare and analyze the reliability of various information and to select more reliable information, it is necessary to judge from various viewpoints.

Critical thinking differs from negative automatic thinking, which is based on one or two events and improperly applied to other dissimilar thoughts or scenes to draw a general conclusion.

Negative prediction, a form of negative automatic thinking, is to arrive at a conclusion that is improper or hasty, without sufficient and adequate evidence, that it will go wrong.
