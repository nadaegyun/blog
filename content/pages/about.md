> A boy dreaming establishing an electronic company making a radio such as SONY and AIWA decided to make a company CI when he was a high school student who had a big interest in philosophy. He thought the company CI should look like our life. Birth, Living, and death.
> It was after class in the class room he just wrote "I was born and I live and I will die."
> He made it as I3A2BLD and decided to study in electronics in the university.
> Time goes by the boy became middle-aged. What now he can do and what he accomplished?
